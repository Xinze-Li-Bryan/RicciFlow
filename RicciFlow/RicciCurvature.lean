# Ricci Curvature

This file defines the Ricci curvature tensor and scalar curvature.

## Main Definitions

* `RicciTensor M`: The Ricci curvature tensor on manifold M
* `scalarCurvature`: The scalar curvature, which is the trace of the Ricci tensor

## Implementation Notes

The current implementation is simplified, storing the scalar curvature value directly
in the RicciTensor structure. A complete implementation should compute it from the
metric tensor and Riemann curvature tensor via contraction.

/-- Simplified representation of the Ricci curvature tensor.

Mathematically, the Ricci tensor Ric is obtained by contracting the Riemann curvature tensor:
  Ric_ij = R^k_{ikj}

In a complete implementation, this should be a (0,2)-tensor field.
The current simplified version directly stores its trace (scalar curvature).

## Future Extensions
* Add complete tensor component representation
* Implement tensor operations (addition, scalar multiplication)
* Compute Ricci tensor from Riemann curvature tensor

  /-- The value of the scalar curvature, i.e., the trace of the Ricci tensor R = g^{ij} Ric_{ij}.

  This is a simplified representation. A complete implementation should store all components
  and then compute the scalar curvature by contracting with the inverse metric. -/

/-- Scalar curvature.

Mathematical definition: The scalar curvature is the contraction of the Ricci tensor
with the inverse metric:
  R = g^{ij} Ric_{ij}

where:
* g^{ij} is the inverse of the Riemannian metric
* Ric_{ij} are the components of the Ricci tensor
* Einstein summation convention is used

## Geometric Meaning

The scalar curvature measures the "total curvature" of the manifold at a point.
* R > 0: the manifold curves inward like a sphere near this point
* R < 0: the manifold curves outward like hyperbolic space near this point
* R = 0: the manifold is locally flat (like Euclidean space) near this point

## Implementation Notes

The current implementation directly extracts the precomputed value from the RicciTensor structure.
This is a simplified version. A complete implementation should:
1. Obtain all components Ric_{ij} from RicciTensor
2. Compute the inverse metric g^{ij} from RiemannianMetric
3. Compute the contraction g^{ij} Ric_{ij}

This lemma is trivial in the current simplified implementation, but provides an interface
for future extensions. When complete tensor computations are implemented, the proof of this
lemma will become non-trivial. -/
