properties of the 3-sphere S³.

## Completion Status

       → PathConnectedSpace.connectedSpace
     ```
   - **Status**: Proven modulo `sphere_path_connected` axiom

### ⏳ Axiomatized (Awaiting proof)

4. **sphere_path_connected**: Spheres Sⁿ (n ≥ 1) are path-connected
   - **Location**: [Poincare/Core/TopologyInput.lean:107-108](file:///Users/lixinze/RicciFlow/Poincare/Core/TopologyInput.lean#L107-L108)
   - **Type**: `∀ (n : ℕ) (hn : n ≥ 1), PathConnectedSpace (ULift (Metric.sphere 0 1))`
   - **Why axiomatized**: Requires manifold structure theory
   - **Proof strategy**:
     - Use `EuclideanSpace.instIsManifoldSphere` from mathlib
     - Manifolds of dimension ≥ 1 are path-connected
     - Connect two points via a continuous path along the sphere
   - **Future work**: Should be provable using mathlib's manifold library

5. **sphere3_simply_connected**: S³ is simply connected
   - **Location**: [Poincare/Core/TopologyInput.lean:123](file:///Users/lixinze/RicciFlow/Poincare/Core/TopologyInput.lean#L123)
   - **Type**: `SimplyConnectedSpace Sphere3`
   - **Why axiomatized**: Requires algebraic topology (Hopf fibration or covering spaces)
   - **Proof strategies**:

     **Method 1: Hopf Fibration**
     - Construct Hopf map S³ → S² with fiber S¹
     - Use long exact sequence: π₂(S²) → π₁(S¹) → π₁(S³) → π₁(S²)
     - Since π₂(S²) = 0 and π₁(S²) = 0, conclude π₁(S³) = 0

     **Method 2: Covering Space Theory**
     - Construct universal cover of S³
     - Show universal cover is S³ itself (i.e., simply connected)

     **Method 3: Seifert-van Kampen**
     - Decompose S³ as union of two contractible sets
     - Apply Seifert-van Kampen theorem

   - **Future work**: Requires mathlib's homotopy group theory

## Mathematical Content

### Compactness Proof (Detailed)

**Theorem**: S³ is compact.

**Proof**:
1. S³ is defined as `ULift (Metric.sphere (0 : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 4)) 1)`
2. `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 4)` is a finite-dimensional normed space
3. Finite-dimensional normed spaces are `ProperSpace` (mathlib instance)
4. In proper spaces, closed balls are compact (Heine-Borel)
5. Metric spheres are closed subsets of closed balls
6. Closed subsets of compact sets are compact
7. Therefore `Metric.sphere 0 1` is compact
8. Mathlib provides instance `Metric.sphere.compactSpace`
9. `CompactSpace` is preserved by `ULift` (proven in SphereProperties.lean)
10. Therefore S³ is compact ∎

### Hausdorff Proof (Detailed)

**Theorem**: S³ is Hausdorff (T2).

**Proof**:
1. S³ is defined as `ULift (Metric.sphere (0 : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 4)) 1)`
2. `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 4)` is a `PseudoMetricSpace`
3. Pseudo metric spaces are T2 (mathlib: `PseudoMetricSpace.toT2Space`)
4. Subtypes of T2 spaces are T2
5. Therefore `Metric.sphere 0 1` is T2
6. `T2Space` is preserved by `ULift` (proven in SphereProperties.lean)
7. Therefore S³ is T2 ∎

### Connectivity Proof (Partial)

**Theorem**: S³ is connected.

**Proof**:
1. We prove S³ is path-connected
2. Path-connected implies connected (mathlib: `PathConnectedSpace.connectedSpace`)
3. For path-connectivity: use axiom `sphere_path_connected`
4. This axiom states that Sⁿ is path-connected for n ≥ 1
5. Apply to n = 3 to get `PathConnectedSpace Sphere3`
6. Therefore S³ is connected ∎

**Note**: Step 3-4 currently use an axiom, but should be provable using:
- Manifold structure on spheres (mathlib has `EuclideanSpace.instIsManifoldSphere`)
- General theorem: connected manifolds of dimension ≥ 1 are path-connected
- Or direct construction: given two points on sphere, connect via great circle

## Axiom Count Reduction

**Before this work**:
- 4 axioms: `sphere3_t2`, `sphere3_compact`, `sphere3_connected`, `sphere3_simply_connected`

**After this work**:
- 2 axioms: `sphere_path_connected`, `sphere3_simply_connected`
- 2 proven instances: `sphere3_t2`, `sphere3_compact`
- 1 partial proof: `sphere3_connected` (proven modulo path-connectivity axiom)

**Percentage reduction**: 50% (4 → 2 axioms)

## Dependencies on mathlib

### Imports added:
```lean
import Mathlib.Topology.MetricSpace.ProperSpace
import Mathlib.Topology.MetricSpace.Basic
import Mathlib.Topology.Connected.PathConnected
```

### Key mathlib instances used:
1. `ProperSpace (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n))` - from finite dimensionality
2. `Metric.sphere.compactSpace` - compactness of metric spheres in proper spaces
3. `PseudoMetricSpace.toT2Space` - metric spaces are Hausdorff
4. `PathConnectedSpace.connectedSpace` - path-connected implies connected

## Next Steps

### Immediate (to complete S³ properties):

1. **Prove `sphere_path_connected`** (moderate difficulty)
   - Search mathlib for path-connectivity of manifolds
   - Use `EuclideanSpace.instIsManifoldSphere`
   - Connect two non-antipodal points via great circle
   - Connect antipodal points via third point
   - Estimated: 50-100 lines of proof

2. **Prove `sphere3_simply_connected`** (high difficulty)
   - Requires homotopy group theory from mathlib
   - May need to wait for more mathlib infrastructure
   - Or formalize Hopf fibration from scratch
   - Estimated: 200-500 lines of proof

### Phase 2 (user requested):

After completing S³ properties, proceed with Perelman entropy theory:
- Implement W-entropy functional
- Prove W-entropy monotonicity
- Implement F-functional and ν-entropy

## Technical Notes

### Type System Challenges Solved

1. **Universe polymorphism**:
   - TopCat.sphere uses ULift for universe management
   - Had to prove ULift preserves topological properties

2. **Bundled vs unbundled**:
   - TopCat.sphere is a bundled category object
   - Used coercion `↑` to extract underlying type
   - Sphere3 defined as `↑(TopCat.sphere 3)`

3. **Instance synthesis**:
   - `inferInstance` initially failed
   - Used `inferInstanceAs` with explicit target type
   - Helped Lean's type class resolution

### Proof Technique: inferInstanceAs

Instead of:
```lean
instance sphere3_compact : CompactSpace Sphere3 := by
  unfold Sphere3
  exact inferInstance  -- fails!
```

We use:
```lean
instance sphere3_compact : CompactSpace Sphere3 :=
  inferInstanceAs (CompactSpace (ULift (Metric.sphere 0 1)))  -- succeeds!
```

This explicitly guides type inference to the correct path.

- `Mathlib/Topology/Separation/Hausdorff.lean` - T2 spaces
- `Mathlib/Topology/Connected/PathConnected.lean` - path connectivity
- `Mathlib/Topology/Category/TopCat/Sphere.lean` - sphere definitions
- `Mathlib/Geometry/Manifold/Instances/Sphere.lean` - manifold structure

**Lean 4 features used**:
- Type class inference
- `inferInstanceAs` for explicit instance synthesis
- Coercions for bundled → unbundled types
- Tactic mode proofs

## Conclusion

We successfully reduced the axiom count for S³ properties from 4 to 2,
with 2 properties fully proven and 1 property proven modulo a general
axiom about sphere path-connectivity.

The remaining work (path-connectivity and simple-connectivity) requires
deeper algebraic topology infrastructure, which is a natural next step
for the formalization project.

All changes compile successfully and maintain the project's build integrity.
