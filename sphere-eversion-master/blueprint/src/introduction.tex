\chapter*{Introduction}
\label{cha:intro}

This project had two goals. First we wanted to check whether a proof
assistant can do differential topology. Many people still think that
formal mathematics are mostly suitable for algebra, combinatorics, or
foundational studies. So we chose one of the most famous examples
of geometric topology theorems associated to tricky geometric intuition:
the existence of sphere eversions. Note however that we won't focus on
any of the many videos of explicit sphere eversions. We will prove a
general theorem which immediately implies the existence of sphere
eversions.

The second goal of this project was to experiment using a formalization
blueprint that evolves with the project until we get a proof that has
very closely related formal and informal presentations. A full proof (by
normal pen and paper standards) was written before the formalization
effort began. This proof evolved a lot during the formalization. In
particular, the chapter on the global theory required a lot of work
during the formalization in order to ensure that its technical lemmas
are both fully correct and actually sufficient for our purposes.

In this introduction, we will describe the mathematical context of this
project, the main definitions and statements, and outline the proof
strategy.

Gromov observed that it's often fruitful to distinguish two kinds of geometric
construction problems. He says that a geometric construction problem satisfies
the $h$-principle if the only obstructions to the existence of a solution come
from algebraic topology. In this case, the construction is called flexible,
otherwise it is called rigid. This definition is purposely vague. We
will see a rather general way to give it a precise meaning, but one must keep
in mind that such a precise meaning will fail to encompass a number of
situations that can be illuminated by the $h$-principle dichotomy point of view.

The easiest example of a flexible construction problem which is not totally
trivial and is algebraically obstructed is the deformation of immersions
of circles into planes. Let $f_0$ and $f_1$ be two maps from $ùïä^1$ to $‚Ñù^2$
that are immersions. Since $ùïä^1$ has dimension one, this mean that both
derivatives $f_0'$ and $f_1'$ are nowhere vanishing maps from $ùïä^1$ to
$‚Ñù^2$. The geometric object we want to construct is a (smooth) homotopy
of immersions from $f_0$ to $f_1$, ie a smooth map $F \co ùïä^1 √ó [0, 1] ‚Üí ‚Ñù^2$
such that $\rst{F}{ùïä^1 √ó \{0\}} = f_0$, $\rst{F}{ùïä^1 √ó \{1\}} = f_1$, and
each $f_p := \rst{F}{ùïä^1 √ó \{p\}}$ is an immersion. If such a homotopy
exists then, $(t, p) ‚Ü¶ f_p'(t)$ is a homotopy from $f_0'$ to $f_1'$ among
maps from $ùïä^1$ to $‚Ñù^2 ‚àñ \{0\}$. Such maps have a well defined winding
number $w(f'_i) ‚àà ‚Ñ§$ around the origin, the degree of the normalized map
$f'_i/‚Äñf'_i‚Äñ \co ùïä^1 ‚Üí ùïä^1$. So $w(f_0') = w(f_1')$ is a necessary condition
for the existence of $F$, which comes from algebraic topology.  The
Whitney--Graustein theorem states that this necessary condition is also
sufficient. Hence this geometric construction problem is flexible.  One
can give a direct proof of this result, but it also
follows from general results proved in this project (although we
haven't formalized this consequence of our work).

An important lesson from the above example is that algebraic topology
can give us more than a necessary condition. Indeed the (one-dimensional)
Hopf degree theorem ensures that, provided $w(f'_0) = w(f'_1)$, there
exists a homotopy $g_p$ of nowhere vanishing maps relating $f'_0$ and
$f'_1$. We also know from the topology of $‚Ñù^2$ that $f_0$ and $f_1$ are
homotopic, say using the straight-line homotopy
$p ‚Ü¶ f_p = (1-p)f_0 + pf_0$. But there is no a priori relation
between $g_p$ and the derivative of $f_p$ for $p ‚àâ \{0, 1\}$.
So we can restate the crucial part of the
Whitney--Graustein theorem as: there is a homotopy of immersion from
$f_0$ to $f_1$ as soon as there is (a homotopy from $f_0$ to $f_1$) and
a homotopy from $f_0'$ to $f_1'$ among nowhere vanishing maps. The
parenthesis in the previous sentence indicated that this condition is
always satisfied, but it is important to keep in mind for
generalizations. Gromov says that such a homotopy of uncoupled pairs
$(f, g)$ is a formal solution of the original problem.

One can generalize this discussion of uncoupled maps replacing a
map and its derivative for maps from a manifold $M$
to a manifold $N$. The so called $1$-jet space $J^1(M, N)$ is the
space of triples $(m, n, œÜ)$ with $m ‚àà M$, $n ‚àà N$, and
$œÜ ‚àà \Hom(T_mM, T_nN)$, the space of linear maps from $T_mM$ to $T_nN$.
One can define a smooth manifold structure on $J^1(M, N)$, of dimension
$\dim(M) + \dim(N) + \dim(M)\dim(N)$ which fibers over $M$, $N$ and
their product $J^0(M, N) := M √ó N$. Beware that the notation $(m, n, œÜ)$
does not mean that $J^1(M, N)$ is a product of three manifolds, the space
where $œÜ$ lives depends on $m$ and $n$.
Any smooth map $f \co M ‚Üí N$ gives rise to a section $j^1f$ of
$J^1(M, N) ‚Üí M$ defined by $j^1f(m) = (m, f(m), T_m f)$. Such a section is
called a \emph{holonomic section} of $J^1(M, N)$.
In the Whitney--Graustein example, we use the canonical trivialization of
$Tùïä^1$ and $T‚Ñù^2$ to represent $j^1f$ has a pair of maps $(f, f')$. The
role played by $(f, g)$ in this example is played in general by sections
of $J^1(M, N) ‚Üí M$ which are not necessarily holonomic.

One can generalize this discussion to $J^r(M, N)$ which remembers
derivatives of maps up to order $r$ for some given $r ‚â• 0$. One can also
consider sections of an arbitrary bundle $E ‚Üí M$ instead of functions
from $M$ to $N$, which are sections of the trivial bundle $M √ó N ‚Üí N$.
But the case of $J^1(M, N)$ is sufficient for our purposes.

\begin{definition-intro}
  A first order differential relation $\Rel$ for maps from $M$ to
  $N$ is a subset of $J^1(M, N)$. A solution of $\Rel$ is a function
  $f \co M \to N$ such that $j^1f(m)$ is in $\Rel$ for all $m$.
  A \emph{formal solution} of $\Rel$ is a non-necessarily holonomic
  section of $J^1(M, N) ‚Üí M$ which takes value in $\Rel$.

  The partial differential relation $\Rel$ satisfies the $h$-principle
  if any formal solution $œÉ$ of $\Rel$ is homotopic, among formal
  solutions, to some holonomic one $j^1f$.
\end{definition-intro}

For instance, an immersion of $M$ into $N$ is a solution of
\[
\Rel = \{(m, n, œÜ) ‚àà J^1(M, N) \;|\; œÜ \text{ is injective}\}.
\]
As we saw with
the Whitney--Graustein problem, we are not only interested to individual
solutions, but also in families of solutions. In differential
topology, a smooth family of maps between manifolds $X$ and $Y$ is a smooth map
$h \co P √ó X ‚Üí Y$ seen as the collection of maps $h_p \co x ‚Ü¶ h(p, x)$. Here $P$
stands for ``parameter space''. A smooth family of sections of $E ‚Üí X$ is a
smooth family of maps $œÉ \co P √ó X ‚Üí E$ such that each $œÉ_p$ is a section.

In such a case it is important that we start with a family of formal solutions
that is holonomic for some values of the parameter and we don't modify it for
those parameters. In the curve example $P = [0, 1]$, the formal solution is
holonomic for parameters $0$ and $1$, and we want to keep the start and end
curves. In this work we don't use manifolds with boundary when it is not
necessary so we rather use $‚Ñù$ as a parameter space.

More generally it can also happen that a family of formal solutions
$œÉ : P √ó M ‚Üí J^1(M, N)$ has the property that $œÉ_p$ is holonomic at $m ‚àà M$ for
some values of $p$ and $m$ and we want to preserve $œÉ$ near the corresponding
set in $P √ó M$. This leads to the following definition.


\begin{definition-intro}
  A partial differential relation $\Rel ‚äÇ J^1(M, N)$ satisfies the relative and
  parametric $h$-principle if every family of formal solutions
  $œÉ \co M √ó P ‚Üí J^1(M, N)$ which are holonomic for $(p, m)$ near some closed
  set $C ‚äÇ P √ó M$, is homotopic to a family of holonomic sections, and this
  homotopy can be chosen constant near $C$.
\end{definition-intro}

One can also insist on the deformed solution to be $C^0$-close to the original
one. In this case one talks about a $C^0$-dense $h$-principle.

Using this vocabulary, we can state the Smale-Hirsch immersion theorem as saying
that the relation of immersions satisfies all forms of the $h$-principle provided
the dimension of the target manifold is larger than the dimension of the source.

This theorem covers the Whitney--Graustein theorem (in its second
form, assuming the existence of a homotopy between derivatives). But there are
much less intuitive applications. The most famous one is the existence of
sphere eversions: one can ``turn $ùïä^2$ inside-out among immersions of $ùïä^2$ into
$‚Ñù^3$).

\begin{corollary-intro}[Smale 1958]
	There is a homotopy of immersion of $ùïä^2$ into $‚Ñù^3$ from the inclusion map to
	the antipodal map $a \co q ‚Ü¶ -q$.
\end{corollary-intro}

The reason why this is turning the sphere inside-out is that $a$ extends as
a map from $‚Ñù^3 ‚àñ \{0\} ‚Üí ‚Ñù^3 ‚àñ \{0\}$ by
\[
	\hat{a} \co q ‚Ü¶ -\frac{1}{‚Äñq‚Äñ^2}q
\]
which exchanges the interior and exterior of $ùïä^2$. More abstractly, one can say
the normal bundle of $ùïä^2$ is trivial, hence one can extend $a$ to a tubular
neighborhood of $ùïä^2$ as an orientation preserving map. Since $a$ is orientation
reversing, any such extension will be reversing co-orientation.

\begin{proof}[Proof of the sphere eversion corollary]
	We denote by $Œπ$ the inclusion of $ùïä^2$ into $‚Ñù^3$.
	We set $j_t = (1-t)Œπ	+ ta$. This is a homotopy from $Œπ$ to $a$ (but not an
	immersion for $t=1/2$).
  We need to check there is no obstruction to building a homotopy of formal
  solutions above those maps. One could show that the relevant homotopy group
  (replacing $œÄ_1(ùïä^1)$ from the Whitney--Graustein example) is
  $\pi_2(\SO_3(‚Ñù))$. This group is trivial, hence there is no obstruction. But
  actually we can write an explicit homotopy here, without computing
  $\pi_2(\SO_3(‚Ñù))$.  Using the canonical trivialization of the tangent
	bundle of $‚Ñù^3$, we can set, for $(q, v) ‚àà Tùïä^2$,
	$G_t(q, v) = \mathrm{Rot}_{Oq}^{œÄt}(v)$, the rotation around axis $Oq$ with
	angle $œÄt$. The family $œÉ \co t ‚Ü¶ (j_t, G_t)$ is a homotopy of formal immersions
	relating $j^1Œπ$ to $j^1a$. The above theorem ensures this family is homotopic,
	relative to $t = 0$ and $t = 1$, to a family of holonomic formal immersions,
	ie a family $t ‚Ü¶ j^1f_t$ with $f_0 = Œπ$, $f_1 = a$, and each $f_t$ is an
	immersion.
\end{proof}

The Smale-Hirsch theorem and its above corollary follows from a more general theorem:
the $h$-principle for open and ample first order differential relations (see
below). We will prove this theorem using a technique which is even more
general: convex integration. For instance this technique also underlies the
constructions of paradoxical isometric embeddings, which could be a nice
follow-up project.

We'll end this introduction by describing the key construction of convex
integration, since it is very nice and elementary. Convex integration
was invented by Gromov around 1970, inspired in particular by the
$C^1$ isometric embedding work of Nash and the original proof of
flexibility of immersions. This term is pretty vague however, and there
are several different implementations. The newest one, and by far the
most efficient one, is M√©lanie Theilli√®re's corrugation process from
2018. And this is what we will use.

Let $f$ be a map from $‚Ñù^n$ to $‚Ñù^m$. Say we want to turn $f$ into a
solution of some partial differential relation. For instance if we are
interested in immersions, we want to make sure its differential is everywhere
injective. We will ensure this by tackling each partial derivative in turn. In
the immersion example, we first make sure $‚àÇ_1f(x) := ‚àÇf(x)/‚àÇx_1$ is non-zero
for all $x$. Then we make sure $‚àÇ_2f(x)$ is not colinear to $‚àÇ_1f(x)$. Then we
make sure $‚àÇ_3f(x)$ is not in the plane spanned by the two previous
derivatives, etc\dots\ until all $n$ partial derivatives are everywhere
linearly independent.

In general, what happens is that, for each number $j$ between $1$ and
$n$, we wish $‚àÇ_jf(x)$ could live in some open subset
$Œ©_x ‚äÇ ‚Ñù^m$. Assume there is a smooth family of loops $Œ≥ \co ‚Ñù^n √ó ùïä^1 ‚Üí ‚Ñù^m$ such
that each $Œ≥_x$ takes values in $Œ©_x$, and has average value
$\int_{ùïä^1} Œ≥_x = ‚àÇ_j f(x)$. Obviously such loops
can exist only if $‚àÇ_jf(x)$ is in the convex hull of $Œ©_x$,
and we will see this condition is
almost sufficient. In the immersion case, this convex hull condition
will always be met because, from the above description, we see that
$Œ©_x$ will always be the complement of a linear subspace with
codimension at least two.

For some large positive $N$, we replace $f$ by the new map
\[
  x ‚Ü¶ f(x) + \frac1N  ‚à´_0^{Nx_j} \left[Œ≥_x(s) - ‚àÇ_jf(x)\right]ds.
\]

A wonderfully easy exercise shows that, provided $N$ is large enough,
we have achieved $‚àÇ_j f(x) ‚àà Œ©_x$, almost without modifying
derivatives $‚àÇ_i f(x)$ for $i ‚â† j$, and almost without moving
$f(x)$. See \ref{prop:theilliere} for a precise statement.
This technique is called convex integration
since we are taking an integral under the assumption that
$‚àÇ_jf(x)$ is in the convex hull of $Œ©_x$.

In addition, if we assume that $Œ≥_x$ is constant (necessarily with value
$‚àÇ_j f(x)$) for $x$ near some subset $K$ where
$‚àÇ_j f(x)$ was already good, then nothing changed on $K$ since the
integrand vanishes there. It is also easy to damp out this modification
by multiplying the integral by a cut-off function. So this is a very
local construction, and it isn't obvious how the absence of homotopical
obstruction, embodied by the existence of a formal solution, should
enter the discussion. The answer is that is essentially provides a way
to coherently choose base points for the $Œ≥_x$ loops.

Now that we've seen how convex hulls enter the discussion we can provide one
last definition and state the actual main theorem that we formalized.

\begin{definition-intro}
  A relation $\Rel ‚äÇ J^1(M, N)$ is ample if, for every $(x, y, œÜ) ‚àà \Rel$ and
  every hyperplane $H ‚äÇ T_xM$, the convex hull of the connected component of $œÜ$ in
  \[
    \left\{œà ‚àà \Hom(T_xM, T_yN) \;|\; \rst{œà}{H} = \rst{œÜ}{H} \text{ and } (x, y, œà) ‚àà \Rel\right\}
  \]
  is the whole set of $œà$ such that $\rst{œà}{H} = \rst{œÜ}{H}$.
\end{definition-intro}

We can now state our goal in its full glory.

\begin{theorem-intro}[Gromov]
  For any manifolds $M$ and $N$, any relation $\Rel ‚äÇ J^1(M, N)$ that is open
  and ample satisfies the full $h$-principle (relative, parametric and $C^0$-dense).
\end{theorem-intro}

\Cref{chap:loops} provides the loops supply. \Cref{chap:local} then
discusses the local theory, including the key construction above,
and \cref{chap:global} finally moves to manifolds, and proves the main
theorem and its sphere eversion corollary.
\Cref{chap:local_eversion} explains how the first two chapters are already
enough to derive Smale's theorem, although in a slightly less natural way than
using the manifold case. This served as an intermediate target in the
formalization, and can be used for elementary teaching since it does not
require any theory of manifolds.
