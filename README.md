> **Formalizing one of mathematics' greatest achievements: Perelman's proof of the Poincaré Conjecture using Ricci Flow with surgery**

## 📐 The Poincaré Conjecture

The Poincaré Conjecture, proposed by Henri Poincaré in 1904, is one of the most famous problems in mathematics:

> **Every simply-connected, closed 3-manifold is homeomorphic to the 3-sphere.**

In simpler terms: if a 3-dimensional shape has no holes and is finite, it must be topologically equivalent to the surface of a 4-dimensional ball.

This conjecture remained unsolved for nearly a century until Grigori Perelman proved it using Ricci Flow theory in 2002-2003, earning him the Fields Medal (which he declined) and the Millennium Prize (which he also declined).

## 🎯 Project Goals

This project aims to:

1. **Formalize Perelman's proof** of the Poincaré Conjecture in Lean 4
2. **Build a complete Ricci Flow theory** from first principles  
3. **Implement geometric surgery** procedures for handling singularities
4. **Prove finite extinction** for simply-connected 3-manifolds
5. **Establish the topological conclusion**: extinction implies homeomorphism to S³

## 🏗️ Project Structure

The formalization is organized in two layers:

## 🔬 The Proof Strategy

Perelman's proof follows this logical chain:

```
1. Simply-connected closed 3-manifold M
   ↓
2. Assign Riemannian metric g₀
   ↓
3. Evolve via Ricci Flow (∂g/∂t = -2·Ric)
   ↓
4. Encounter singularity → Identify ε-necks
   ↓
5. Perform Perelman surgery (cut necks, glue caps)
   ↓
6. Continue flow with surgery (iteratively)
   ↓
7. Finite extinction time T_ext < ∞
   ↓
8. Topology conclusion: M ≅ S³ ✓
```

### Key Ingredients

1. **W-entropy monotonicity**: Provides control over geometry
2. **κ-noncollapsing theorem**: Prevents volume collapse
3. **κ-solution classification**: Only S³, ℝP³, or S² × ℝ in 3D
4. **Canonical neighborhood theorem**: Singularities are standard (necks or caps)
5. **Finite surgery theorem**: Only finitely many surgeries needed
6. **Finite extinction**: Simply-connected manifolds vanish in finite time
7. **Extinction ⇒ S³**: Topological conclusion from extinction
