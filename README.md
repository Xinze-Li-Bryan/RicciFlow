> **Formalizing Perelman's proof of the Poincaré Conjecture using Ricci Flow with surgery in Lean 4**

## 📐 The Poincaré Conjecture

The Poincaré Conjecture, proposed by Henri Poincaré in 1904, is one of the most famous problems in mathematics:

> **Every simply-connected, closed 3-manifold is homeomorphic to the 3-sphere.**

In simpler terms: if a 3-dimensional shape has no holes and is finite, it must be topologically equivalent to the surface of a 4-dimensional ball.

This conjecture remained unsolved for nearly a century until Grigori Perelman proved it using Ricci Flow theory in 2002-2003, earning him the Fields Medal (which he declined) and the Millennium Prize (which he also declined).

## 🎯 Project Goals

This project aims to formalize Perelman's proof of the Poincaré Conjecture in Lean 4, following these objectives:

1. **Build a complete Ricci Flow theory** from first principles
2. **Implement Perelman's entropy functionals** (W-entropy, F-functional, ν-entropy)
3. **Classify κ-solutions** in dimension 3
4. **Implement geometric surgery** procedures for handling singularities
5. **Prove finite extinction** for simply-connected 3-manifolds
6. **Establish the topological conclusion**: extinction implies homeomorphism to S³

## 🏗️ Project Structure

The formalization is organized in two layers:

## 🔬 The Proof Strategy

Perelman's proof follows this logical chain:

```
1. Simply-connected closed 3-manifold M
   ↓
2. Assign Riemannian metric g₀
   ↓
3. Evolve via Ricci Flow (∂g/∂t = -2·Ric)
   ↓
4. Encounter singularity → Identify ε-necks
   ↓
5. Perform Perelman surgery (cut necks, glue caps)
   ↓
6. Continue flow with surgery (iteratively)
   ↓
7. Finite extinction time T_ext < ∞
   ↓
8. Topology conclusion: M ≅ S³ ✓
```

### Key Ingredients

1. **W-entropy monotonicity**: Provides control over geometry
2. **κ-noncollapsing theorem**: Prevents volume collapse
3. **κ-solution classification**: Only S³, ℝP³, or S² × ℝ in 3D
4. **Canonical neighborhood theorem**: Singularities are standard (necks or caps)
5. **Finite surgery theorem**: Only finitely many surgeries needed
6. **Finite extinction**: Simply-connected manifolds vanish in finite time
7. **Extinction ⇒ S³**: Topological conclusion from extinction

### Formalization Approach

This project follows a **top-down formalization strategy**:

1. **Architectural Phase**: Complete proof structure with axioms marking dependencies
2. **Mathlib Integration**: Connecting to existing mathematical libraries
3. **Progressive Refinement**: Gradually replacing axioms with proofs

**Current State**: 10 strategic axioms remain (down from 44), all with clear Mathlib connection paths documented.

## 🔗 Mathlib Integration

This project actively integrates with Mathlib's standard library:

- **Topology**: Using `SimplyConnectedSpace`, `ContractibleSpace` from Mathlib
- **Convex Analysis**: Leveraging `Convex.contractibleSpace` for geometric proofs
- **Fundamental Groupoid**: Building on algebraic topology infrastructure
- **Poincaré Conjecture Declaration**: Mathlib contains `SimplyConnectedSpace.nonempty_homeomorph_sphere_three` which our proof targets

See [MATHLIB_FINDINGS.md](Poincare/Perelman/MATHLIB_FINDINGS.md) for detailed integration status.
